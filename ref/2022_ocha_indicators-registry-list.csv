Sex, age, ability or other relevant diversity disaggregation of the feedback received is important in order to understand who is most at risk and to take responsible actions. It is important to remember that feedback needs to be collected, digested and acted upon, and then the results of those actions relayed to the population, then another round of feedback can begin on the changed situation.

How a cluster or organisation enables key stakeholders to play an active role in the decision-making processes that affect them. It is unrealistic to expect an organisation to engage with all stakeholders over all decisions all of the time. Therefore the organisation must have clear guidelines (and practices) enabling it to prioritize stakeholders appropriately and to be responsive to the differences in power between them.  Mechanisms need to be in place to ensure that the most marginalized and affected are represented and have influence. Participation here also encompasses the processes through which an organisation or cluster monitors and reviews its progress and results against goals and objectives; feeds learning back into the organisation on an on-going basis; and reports on the results of the process. To increase accountability to stakeholders, goals and objectives must be also designed in consultation with those stakeholders. A well known example of participation in developing indicators is the WASH indicator developed by a community which was - ""# of hours girls spend in school"" - highlighting the importance of education to the community, and also that improved water access had improved education possibilities.

The most important of these diseases in most emergencies are various diarrhoeal diseases. Diseases with outbreak risk are those that may spread rapidly and require a rapid response to protect public health. They include cholera, typhoid, shigellosis, and hepatitis A and E. An outbreak, or epidemic, is the occurrence of cases of an illness clearly in excess of what is normally expected in a given area during a given period.

In the acute stages of an emergency this rate may be estimated approximately in a rapid nutritional assessment with a MUAC (mid-upper arm circumference) survey by nutrition staff. Acute food insecurity: A population or livelihood group is considered acutely food insecure if: 1) people experience a large reduction in their major source of food and are unable to make up the difference through copying strategies; 2) the prevalence of malnutrition is abnormally high for the time of year, and this cannot be accounted for by either health or care factors; 3) a large proportion of the population uses marginal or unsustainable coping strategies; 4) people use 'coping' strategies that are damaging their livelihoods in the longer term, or incur some other unacceptable cost, such as acting illegally or immorally. There is no established equivalence between the levels of global acute malnutrition and acute food security used in the scoring system for this indicator. They are used here to indicate food and nutrition problems in very broad terms for informing analysis within the WASH cluster. Very High: Global acute malnutrition >14% among under-fives and/or acute food insecurity for >75% of the population. High: Global acute malnutrition 10-14% among under-fives and/or acute food insecurity for 51 75% of the population.

"Water Sanitation Hygiene",W4-1,"W4 Vector Control","Degree of vector-borne disease risk","Malaria: Malaria is one of the major causes of disease and loss of life in emergencies. This indicator is designed to estimate the risk of malaria to the population concerned in general terms, taking into account the following factors: 1) whether or not the area is endemic for malaria; 2) whether or not it is the malaria season; 3) the degree of immunity of the population; 4) the adequacy of measures in place to control malaria transmission. Control measures include rapid and effective management of malaria cases and prevention of transmission through the use of insecticide-treated mosquito nets, the use of repellents, protecting shelters, indoor residual spraying and control of breeding sites. Mosquito-borne diseases other than malaria: diseases such as dengue fever and yellow fever, and other vector-borne diseases such as river blindness and the plague, may be a danger to public health in some circumstances. This indicator is designed to estimate the risk of such diseases to the population concerned in general terms, taking into account the following factors: 1) whether or not the area is endemic for the disease; 2) whether or not it is the season during which the disease is normally transmitted; 3) the degree of immunity of the population; 4) the adequacy of measures in place to control disease transmission. Fly-borne diseases: There is some evidence to suggest that non-biting flies (houseflies, blowflies and several other species) are involved in the transmission of disease by mechanically transferring germs from one place to another, and that the higher the density of flies in a settlement, the greater the intensity of disease transmission. Diseases that may be transmitted by flies include diarrhoeas and other faecal-oral diseases such as typhoid, as well a trachoma. For all of these diseases, flies are just one of a number of pathways of transmission. The density of flies is hard to define in absolute terms.
