Humanitarian outcomes,In-crisis,Food Security,Change in Food Consumption Patterns,"Food consumption patterns is generally measured by two indicators: the Food Consumption Score (FCS) and Household Dietary Diversity Score [HDDS] (either one of them or the two together). Frequency of meals can also be used as proxy for food consumption patterns. The FCS is a composite indicator that measures dietary diversity, food frequency and the relative nutritional importance of food groups based on a seven day recall of food consumed at household level. The HDDS is the simple sum of the number of food groups consumed at HH level based on a 24h recall (from 0 to 12)",Find the Food Consumption Score or Household Dietary Diversity Score in recent food security assessments or multi-sectoral assessments.
