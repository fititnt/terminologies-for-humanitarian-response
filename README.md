# yet-another-ontology-for-humanitarian-emergency-assistance
**Yet Another Ontology for Humanitarian Emergency Assistance contexts...**
**_but_ also encoded engineered with the TLO Basic Formal Ontology (ISO/IEC 21838-2:2021 version).**

This repository is mostly for validate implementations with OWL semantics already not automated (see @EticaAI for that).
Feel free to explore how it works, but as of 2022-09-19,
the URIs are not granted to be permanent to recommend reuse in other ontologies.
Yet, it is Public domain dedication, so anyone can copy parts that meet your needs.

## Where are the other ontologies?
