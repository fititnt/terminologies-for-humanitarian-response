**YAOHEA is an ontology for humanitarian emergency assistance...**
**_but_ also engineered with the Basic Formal Ontology (ISO/IEC 21838-2:2021 version)**.
Why BFO? It is the most used top level ontology (i.e. best interoperability on scientific research),
but also means philosophy ([mereology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mereology)) becomes a requisite to a point [RDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework) feels easy. So. Much. Fun!
