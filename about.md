> _"An ontology is a formal, explicit specification of a shared conceptualization."_
> -- [N. Guarino et al.](https://iaoa.org/isc2012/docs/Guarino2009_What_is_an_Ontology.pdf)

YAOHEA is an early attempt of formal specification using as upper ontology the
[Basic Formal Ontology (BFO)](https://basic-formal-ontology.org/)
and encoding with [Web Ontology Language (OWL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_Language))
of **already existing practices**
on concepts with proof of already be used for data exchange on it's focused area and the authors.

> Trivias:
> 1. The _"Humanitarian Emergency Assistance"_ is based on the title of [A/RES/46/182](https://undocs.org/Home/Mobile?FinalSymbol=A/RES/46/182).
> 2. The _"Yet Another Ontology"_ is based on the fact that a few dozens of formal ontologies in the last decades attempted data exchange on areas related to A/RES/46/182. Some are not even online anymore.
>     1. However, the close to de facto use tend to be limited to lightweight controlled vocabularies

## Relation to existing practices on international humanitarian action

While it does have as starting point one more _top-down approach_
(as the references for _"common operational datasets"_ actually are from _"Common Operational Datasets (CODs endorsed by the guardian UN OCHA)"_)
there's a clear intention of focus on what is know to exist outside target audience of [such CODs](https://cod.unocha.org/). Some implications:

1. **Published ontologies are not literal translations.** The preference labels can intentionally diverge from terminology used either because more common terms exist for such concepts, or special circumstances to avoid confusion.
2. **Please use the numeric codes as stable reference as alternative for labels.** The use of interlingual neutral codes are good practice on ontology engineering, speed up initial work, and allows changes over time without break implementation.

4. (... TODO talk about Wikidata)
